"""Supervisor eventlistener: fail loud, per AGENTS.md and doctrine.

The package's immediate-health shim means nginx answers /healthcheck 200 unconditionally, and
the platform never restarts a running container for a failing health check anyway (verified
platform behaviour). So if gunicorn or celery crash-loops into FATAL, or nginx itself dies for
good, a container that kept running would sit "green" while serving 502s indefinitely. This
listener turns any PROCESS_STATE_FATAL into a full supervisord shutdown: the container exits,
the platform sees a dead container, and the failure is visible instead of silent.

stdout is the eventlistener protocol channel and carries nothing else; diagnostics go to
stderr, which supervisord forwards to the container log.
